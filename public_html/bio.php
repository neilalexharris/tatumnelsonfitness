					<br/>
					<p>
						My background is as an international track and field athlete, with a wealth of experience over 100m, 200m and 400m.
						I competed for Great Britain and England on many occasions, working with and training alongside some of the World’s
						best coaches and athletes. I incorporate the benefits of this rare insight into the world of elite sport with all
						my personal training. I want to share the knowledge I have gained, as all of this experience can be adapted and
						applied to benefit PT sessions.
					</p></br>

					<p>
						Throughout my career I was hampered by injuries and illness, this taught me great resilience and how to adapt
						my training to keep progressing. It was a huge lesson in the right and wrong ways of exercising the body! This
						has given me a natural intuition in prescribing the right exercises for my clients, ensuring they can have a
						long and healthy relationship with exercise, doing types of exercise that are sustainable and become part of
						their lifestyle.
					</p></br>

					<p>
						I also trained as a dancer, staying with dance up to Elementary level in ballet, until my athletics career really
						took off and I had to specialise. This gave me an entirely different perspective of training and conditioning,
						and is something I fuse into my training.
					 </p></br>

					 <p>
						 As well as now being a PT, I am also a Mum to 2 lovely children (and a dog!), which gives me a great understanding
						 of the time constraints and pressures of family life. My training is always tailored to be sympathetic to the
						 external stresses in life - whatever they may be - with a strong focus on overall wellbeing.
