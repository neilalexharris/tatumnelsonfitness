							<p class="lead pt-4 text-justify">
							I started my career as an elite athlete competing for Great Britain and England over 100m, 200m and 400m. I have worked with and trained alongside some of the World’s best coaches and athletes, and incorporate the benefits of this rare insight into the world of elite sport with all my personal training.
							<br><br>
							I have travelled the world training &amp; competing in much of Europe, America, Australia and the Middle East, and during this time I learned how different nations approach health and exercise successfully.
							<br><br>
							My career taught me great resilience and how to adapt my training to keep progressing. It was a huge lesson in the right and wrong ways of exercising the body. This has given me a natural intuition in prescribing the right exercises for my clients, ensuring they can have a long and healthy relationship with exercise, doing types of exercise that are sustainable and become part of their lifestyle.
							<br><br>
							When I stopped my international career, I realised what a huge, underestimated benefit training had had on my mental health, and how physical and mental health work alongside each other, and began
							using my knowledge to help others, developing my unique technique. I am really proud to have gained a lot of success helping clients reach their personal health &amp; fitness goals.
							<br><br>
							Alongside athletics, I trained as a dancer, staying with dance up to Elementary level in ballet, until my athletics career really took off and I had to specialise. Ballet gave me an entirely different perspective of training and conditioning and how the body can utilise its strength. My passion for pilates started here and is something I fuse into my training.
							<br><br>
							I am a mum to 2 lovely children (and a dog!), which has given me a great understanding of the time constraints and pressures of family life. My training is always tailored to be sympathetic to the external stresses in life - whatever they may be. I want exercise, fitness &amp; wellbeing to become part of my client’s lifestyle.
							<br><br>
							<!-- ********************************** OLD BIO ***********************************************************
							<br><br>

							Having a wealth of experience as an elite athlete over 100m, 200m and 400m, Tatum competed for Great Britain and
							England on many occasions and she offers a rare insight into the world of elite sport.
							<br><br>

							Tatum started her career at the age of 14 as one of the best juniors in the World over the sprint
							distances. Her accolades include World Schools 100m Silver medallist and 4x100m Gold medallist; European Junior 100m
							finalist and 4x100m Silver medallist, and still features in Britain's top 10 fastest ever times for 100m and 200m.
							<br><br>

							She has trained with many of athletics' elite, and has also worked with sports people from other disciplines including
							Olympic swimmer Mark Foster and former All Black rugby international Jonah Lomu.
							<br><br>

							During her sporting career Tatum travelled to Europe, the Middle East, America and Australia, gaining experience in how
							other nations approach fitness and she incorporates this into her training programmes.
							<br><br>

							Also a trained dancer, Tatum completed ballet training to Elementary Level, and it was here that her
							passion for fitness began.
